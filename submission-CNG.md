The ... conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of data communication networks and networked systems.

Paper submissions typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. As an aid to the community, the SIGCOMM web site provides [useful advice](https://www.sigcomm.org/publish/hints-tips-and-guides/) to authors planning to submit to SIGCOMM conferences.

To submit papers to the conference, please carefully read the rest of this document which provides information regarding paper formatting, registration, anonymity, and other important issues relevant to your submission.

Then use [the paper submission site](https://....com) to:

- Register your paper by <span style="color:red">{{ site.data.dates.main-registration.date }} 11:59pm ET</span>.
- Submit your paper by <span style="color:red">{{ site.data.dates.main-submission.date }} 11:59pm ET</span>.

These are <span style="color:red">hard deadlines</span> and no extensions will be given.

## Paper Formatting
All submissions must obey the following formatting requirements.

- Submit papers of no more than **<span style="color:red">twelve (12) single--spaced pages</span>**, including figures, tables, any appendices, etc., followed by as many pages as necessary for references. Papers whose non-reference content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed.
- Submit papers formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns. Each column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text.

Please make sure that your submitted paper satisfies the following:
- List the submission number and the number of pages in your paper in the author block, e.g., “Paper #N, 14 pages”, beneath your title. Registering your title, abstract, etc., will provide a paper submission number. Per the anonymity guidelines, remember to remove any author names.
- Provide an abstract of no more than 200 words.
- Number the pages.
- Submit papers in PDF (Portable Document Format) and ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Other formats, including Postscript, will not be accepted. Avoid using non-standard fonts. The PC must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts that are embedded in the PDF file.
- Ensure that the paper prints well on black-and-white printers, not color printers. Pay particular attention to figures and graphs in the paper to ensure that they are legible without color. Explicitly using grayscale colors will provide best control over how graphs and figures will print on black-and-white printers.
- Ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc.
- Limit the file size to less than 15 MB. Contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than 15 MB.


## Paper Registration
[Registration](https://...) only requires submission of paper metadata: paper title and abstract, author names, affiliations, contact email addresses, topics matching the subject matter of the paper, track (experience or main), and conflicts with PC members. The paper itself does not need to be submitted at the registration deadline. However, the paper title and abstract submitted during registration must be complete - not placeholders - and correctly characterize the paper that will be submitted. Authors can change the wording of their titles and abstracts for submission, but their essence should not fundamentally change. The PC will use the information provided during registration as a basis for making review assignments.

Both authors and PC members provide PC conflict information. The PC will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts where necessary. Broadly, we define conflict of interest with a PC member using the following principles:

1. You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the last 12 months, or are going to begin employment at the same institution.
2. You have a professional partnership as follows:
   * Past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.
   * Collaboration on a project, publication, or grant proposal within the past 2 years (i.e., 2016 or later).

If there is no basis for PC conflicts provided by authors, those conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict to avoid having an individual review your paper may lead to your paper being rejected. If you have concerns, please contact the PC chairs.
